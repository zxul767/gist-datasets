# Contents

+ `kdd.tar.gz` is the dataset in our own format. 
+ `source/kdd-original.zip` is the version we used to derive our own, originally obtained from https://github.com/SDuari/Keyword-Extraction-Datasets/raw/master/KDD.zip

**Note:**
We decided not to use the KDD dataset from https://github.com/LIAAD/KeywordExtractor-Datasets because several abstracts (text files) were incomplete (corrupted). Instead we decided to use the KDD dataset from https://github.com/SDuari/Keyword-Extraction-Datasets. The latter considers only those documents that contain at least two sentences and at least one gold-standard keyword (704 documents in total).
